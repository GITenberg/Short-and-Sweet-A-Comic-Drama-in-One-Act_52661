<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. That tiresome husband of mine! What has he
done with himself?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Compose yourself, my dear; men of business,
you know, are not always their own masters. <i>My</i> good man, you see, has not found his
way back yet.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Ah, you quite spoil Mr. Short. You know we
don’t agree upon that subject. (<i>calls</i>) Come, come, William, come and take your
lunch!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>within</i>, <small>R</small>. <i>door</i>) In one minute, my
dear. I’m only just drying my hands.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Vexatious! We shan’t get the things cleared
away all day.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> M<small>R</small>. S<small>WEET</small>, <i>door</i>,
<small>R</small>. 2 <small>E</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Sorry to keep you waiting—couldn’t help it, upon my honour. Just
as I was leaving the office, as the deuce would have it, in came a gentleman on
business—large transfer of stock, &amp;c. &amp;c.—and so I lost the train. Never mind,
there’s plenty of time, so I’ll just snap up a bit of something, and be ready in the crack
of a whip. (<i>sit at table</i>, <small>R</small>., <i>and eats voraciously</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Why, how you are eating, William! One would
think you hadn’t tasted anything before to-day.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Nor more I have—to speak of—I was so late this morning, that I
was obliged to run away without my breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Oh, Mr. Sweet, how can you say so? Why, I
helped you to half a dozen kidneys, at least—there wasn’t one left in the dish for Mr.
Short, when he came down after you left.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. No—did you, though? My impression was I only took a cup of tea;
(<i>eats voraciously</i>) but the fact is, I have so much upon my stomach—I mean upon my
mind—in the way of business, that really these things make very little impression.
However, hang business for to-day, at all events—we shall have a splendid afternoon for
our ride—you’ll enjoy it, I know, Mrs. Short, immensely.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Oh, yes, that I shall of all things—I haven’t
been out for a ride once since my marriage, and I used to be such a horsewoman.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. No; Short don’t like it, I know.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. I should like to see Mr. Short on horseback,
amazingly—ha, ha!—since Gilpin’s ride to Edmonton—ha, ha!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Ha, ha, ha! (<i>checking herself</i>) And
yet, though Henry is rather inclining to be stout, you must admit that he carries himself
remarkably well.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>to</i> M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>) Really, my
dear, you are too severe upon Short.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. I beg your pardon, Louise, I’m sure—I’m such
a simpleton, I must always laugh when I shouldn’t—however, I think you had better make
your arrangements independently of him, for although I don’t want to be a wet blanket, I
am convinced he won’t go.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. No, no—I’ll undertake to persuade him when he comes in.
(S<small>TEPHEN</small> <i>is seen to cross</i> <small>C</small>. <i>from</i>
<small>R</small>. <i>to</i> <small>L</small>.) Isn’t that Stephen going down stairs? Here,
Stephen.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>TEPHEN</small>, <small>L</small>.
<small>C</small>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Step over the way, to the livery stables, and tell them to send round
the horses I chose on my way to town this morning—then go on to Mr. Billington’s—my
compliments, and we shall be happy to join him this afternoon for a ride, at the appointed
time—two o’clock. Let’s see, where did the note say we were to meet him?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>eagerly</i>) In front of the Crystal
Palace.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Ah, exactly—don’t forget, Stephen—two o’clock precisely.</p>

<p>S<small>TEPH</small>. Two o’clock, sir—yes, sir.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, <small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>rising and rubbing his hands</i>) Come, that’s nicely
arranged—we shall have a charming ride over to Dulwich, see the pictures, and get back in
plenty of time to dress before we start to dine with Billington, and then with the box at
the <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span>opera, which he
has so politely presented us with, we shall have made out the day, in a very superior, and
I think I may almost venture to say, aristocratic manner. Come ladies, make haste, get
your habits on, or the horses will be here before you are ready, and you know I can’t bear
to be kept waiting.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. I like that vastly.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What’s the matter?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. You can’t bear to be kept waiting! but you
don’t mind keeping other people waiting—then, too, I am to be ordered about at beck and
call—everything arranged for me beforehand!—I think at least you might have enquired
whether I felt <i>disposed</i> to join you.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Oh, I’m sure, Fanny——</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Why, my dear Mrs. Sweet, you heart the whole thing canvassed this
morning between me and Mrs. Short, and you never made the smallest objection. Besides,
haven’t I only just made you a present of a magnificent riding habit—cost me ten
pounds—and one of the most wicked little wide-awakes in the world, with a bunch of cock’s
feathers, all drooping over the crown! Come, now, you know you are dying to put them
on.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. You think so, do you!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Yes, to be sure I do—you know you’re an arrant coquette.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. I sir!—a coquette.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Ah! ah! didn’t I surprise you trying your hat on fifty different
ways before the glass this very morning—you are caught there, I think!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. It’s not true! You did nothing of the sort!
You’re always saying something of this kind, and since these are the sentiments you
entertain of me, I positively refuse to stir a foot with you—so you may go without me!
(<i>doggedly seating herself</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>eagerly</i>) Oh, Fanny!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>coaxingly</i>) Now, really my dear—you can’t be in
earnest.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>pettishly</i>) No, no, I won’t go!—not an
inch. (<i>crosses and sits</i>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Very well, Mrs. Sweet! very well! The old story! You haven’t
contradicted me before to-day, and so you think it is full time to begin. Was there ever
such caprice? (<i>crosses to</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>anxiously persuading her</i>) My dear
Fanny, now do be reasonable—you are not going to take offence without a cause?—a mere word
in joke—Mr. Sweet was only in fun—were you, Mr. Sweet? After all Mr. Billington’s
politeness too, surely you’ll go, it would seem so personal.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. To be sure! Insult a man like Billington! One of the first houses
in the City! Most respectable delightful creature <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span>like Billington! Why, he keeps two carriages, a couple of
saddle horses, and a buggy!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Come now, Fanny, say you’ll go.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>coaxingly</i>) Do! There’s a ducky!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Well, perhaps, I’ve been too hasty—say you
didn’t mean it, William.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Oh no, my love—upon my honour I didn’t mean it!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Well, then, as Mr. Billington will be
expecting us, I suppose I must go.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Now, if my husband would but come.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Oh, never mind him—if he is not in in time
we’ll go without him. Come, we haven’t a minute to spare, the horses will be here
directly.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>looking after them</i>) “We’ll go without him!” Exactly!
That’s the way she carries it! if <i>I</i> had been the absentee, and had only been a
quarter of a minute behind time, she would go without <i>me</i>, as lieve as look at
me—she treats me as if I had been married twenty years instead of half as many months. But
all applies to Short, just as well as to me, and yet how he lords it over <i>his</i>
wife—she actually seems to doat upon him—fondles him—pats him, gives way to him—whereas
Mrs. Sweet expresses her affection for me by snapping and snubbing, and constant
contradiction. It’s extraordinary, I never perceived it before we took these joint
lodgings down here for the sake of being near the Crystal Palace, for if we did sometimes
quarrel I always coaxed her into good temper again, but since I have witnessed Short’s
happiness I confess my eyes are opened to the different state of things existing in the
two families, and I acknowledge that it irritates me! annoys me! for I begin to feel
myself in a very false and ridiculous position! Oh, I must turn over a new leaf!—I really
must! I wonder how Short does it, for he is nothing like so good-looking as I am—on the
contrary, although he is my most particular friend, he’s a confoundedly ugly fellow.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>TEPHEN</small>,

(<i>lashing the air with his whip</i>) I hope my wife won’t happen to come in just now, I
am hardly safe to be trusted with this whip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>outside</i>) Are the lunch things taken away? I am almost
famished.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. There he is, happy man!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>HORT</small>, <i>door</i>,
<small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>speaking as he comes in</i>) Here, give me a chair! Give me a
chair! I am tired to death—fussed and worried out of my life!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Why, how late you are! We had almost given you up.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. You’re a pretty fellow to complain—here have I been chasing about
the city all day on any empty stomach—I can’t neglect my business as you do, and then I’m
to be told you had nearly given me up, forsooth. Here, Stephen, bring me up something or
other to eat. Why you have hardly left a scrap upon the table—Stephen, some come meat!
(<i>sits in easy chair</i>, <small>L</small>. <i>of table</i>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What, are you going to make a heavy luncheon at this hour of the
day. I am surprised at that habit of yours, Short, I rarely take anything between
breakfast and dinner.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Nor more do I when I <i>get down first.</i> Who devoured the
whole dish of kidneys, and left me nothing for my breakfast but half a round of cold
toast? But, what’s all that about outside? They’re parading four horses up and down before
the house—one great brute nearly ran over me as I was crossing the road.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>sits</i> <small>R</small>. <i>of table</i>,
<small>L</small>.) That’s exactly what you said when you knocked down that Shetland pony
in the Borough and trod upon it, and then came fainting into a pastrycook’s shop, swearing
you had been run over. What, didn’t I tell you then that we are all going out for a
ride?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. What do you mean by <i>all?</i> <i>I</i> am not going, I can tell
you. Do you think, at my time of life, I would trust myself to the back of a horse from a
livery stable? Why, when I was fifteen or twenty years younger, in my wildest days, I
never permitted myself anything beyond a donkey on the sands at Ramsgate, and then only a
quiet one. I never could bear a fiery donkey.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Come now, you are not going to spoil sport—your wife has set her
heart upon it. (<i>rises and goes to</i> S<small>HORT</small>)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. <i>My</i> wife, Sweet, never sets her heart upon anything but
what mine’s set on too, so you may send back two of the horses, I promise you.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Do you mean to say you are going to take this step without first
consulting your wife?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Of course, I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What, on your own private authority, refuse Mrs. Short?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Refuse! There will be no necessity for that—I shall just say <i>I
don’t go</i>, and she won’t go either.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>imitating</i>) Oh, you’ll just say “You don’t go,” and she
won’t go either, eh? (<i>aside</i>) Bluebeard! (<i>aloud</i>) Now really, Short, you are
joking with me!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. You’ll soon see whether I’m in earnest.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What, do you mean to pretend that she’ll give in without
disputing the point—without a quarrel?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Not the slightest—<i>my</i> wife always does as I wish her.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Oh, so does mine, so does mine, when we both wish alike. Come, I
bet you five pounds she goes.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Done! I tell you what it is, Sweet, when a woman once falls
violently in love with a man there’s no end to the influence he has over her.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Conceited old hippopotamus! (<i>aloud</i>) You’ll
lose your money, depend upon it, <i>she’ll</i> not give way.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Well we shall see about that, for here she comes.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>, <i>in hat and

(<i>with marked playfulness patting his cheek</i>) You naughty hubby to be so late.
(<i>crosses to</i> S<small>HORT</small>)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Yes, Loo, here I am, very tired, I can tell you, and ravenous for
something to eat.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Oh, dear, dear, what can I tell them to get
you?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Never mind, there is something coming—I have taken care of
myself—but, bless my heart, Loo, how smart you are! Why, you look as if you were going to
“ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross.”</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>timidly</i>) Fanny and Mr. Sweet have
been proposing——</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. A ride on horseback—yes, I know—quite a cavalcade. Sweet has been
telling me. But shouldn’t you have waited for my return before you gave your consent?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What a terrible crime!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Well, Henry, dear, I didn’t think you
would—</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. You know, Louisa, I am not fond of equestrian exercise. I never
even go to Astley’s—but since you have been at the trouble of dressing yourself, why I
suppose I mustn’t disappoint Mrs. Sweet and her husband.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>pleased</i>) Thank you, Harry, that’s
kind.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) There’s five pounds in my pocket.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>ill-humouredly</i>) At the same time, of course, it will be
very dull and uncomfortable for me to be left all alone here <span class="pagenum"><a

wives, you always think of yourselves first. (<i>with increasing ill humour</i>) But who
the deuce was it put the idea into your head?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Why, <i>I</i> did, I believe: but to confess the truth, I should
never have dreamt of the thing if it hadn’t been for Mr.——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>alarmed, and checking</i>
S<small>WEET</small>) No, no! Never mind—it’s of no consequence—don’t let us talk any more
about it! (<i>she begins to pull off her gloves</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Why, Mrs. Short—what are you doing? (<i>rises</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. I see my husband doesn’t wish me to go, and I
feel now it wouldn’t be right to leave him; so, although he has given me <i>full
permission</i> to go, I shall not avail myself of his <i>kindness</i>——</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>looking at</i> S<small>WEET</small>) A—hem!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) How on earth does he do it? What can be the nature
of the influence? He must do something to her.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Well, since I am not going, I may as well
take off my things. (<i>to</i> S<small>WEET</small>) You’ll explain matters to Fanny.
(<i>aside</i>) What a fright he gave me! (<i>crossing</i>) Just as everything was arranged
so nicely—how vexatious!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. No—the girl’s devoted to me, that’s all.</p>

Zounds, I shall become unhappy if I do—I won’t stand it, Short! Hang me if go to Dulwich

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. What for? We are all ready, and here’s Mr.
Short come home.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Yes, but you see he is busy. (<i>pointing to</i>
S<small>HORT</small>, <i>who is eating voraciously</i>) He doesn’t wish to go, and
<i>his</i> wife remains at home to keep him company.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. But what in the name of goodness has all this
to do with us?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. I tell you, Short doesn’t want to go—and I desire, Mrs. Sweet,
there may be no further discussion on the subject—you understand! (<i>imitating</i>
S<small>HORT</small>) “I don’t go!” (<i>aside</i>) That’s it, I think, as near as a

to go</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Stop a moment, Stephen.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. How, Mrs. Sweet, you venture to counter-order——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. No, no, but tell me. How strange you are—just
now, when I didn’t care about going, you were violently in favour of it; and now that I
have consented and dressed myself to please you, you want to stay at home. My dear
William—what nonsense! Of course, we must go now you have sent to say so. What can you be
thinking about?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) There she is again—arguing the point with me! How
different with Short; and yet that great hulky fellow, insensible of his own happiness,
sits there stuffing ready to burst himself.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>looking up from his knife and fork</i>) Well, have you
settled the point?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. My dear, Stephen is waiting for orders.
(<i>coaxingly</i>) You know I have already given way to you, Willie—it’s now your
turn.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I feel that I am yielding, and I can’t help it.
(<i>aloud</i>) Well, that’s true—so you did. (<i>aside</i>) Short’s laughing at me; but I
mustn’t exact too much from her at once.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Come, come—we shall be keeping them
waiting.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Ah, to be sure, I didn’t think of that. (<i>apologetically to</i>
S<small>HORT</small>, <i>and crossing to him</i>) You that makes all the difference,
Short. We have friends waiting for us. Stephen, you can tell the man to take back only two
of the horses.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, <small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.</p>

give me a kiss, and then get your hat, and let us be off.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Certainly, Fanny, that habit of yours is monstrously becoming to
you! (<i>kisses her—aside</i>) That’s all very well in its way, but I’m a great ass for my

you if we are not ten times better off comfortably at home here with a good luncheon

dine there to-day—a remarkably nice young man that Mr. Billington—he is particularly civil
to me lately whenever he meets me in the City—I am sure nothing could be more polite and

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Yes, it’s one of your brace buttons, don’t you see.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>recovering from her alarm</i>) It is

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>to</i> S<small>WEET</small>) You would go showing off your

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Not at all, I assure you. I was going along as quietly as
possible, getting gradually more confident and comfortable, when all of a sudden a cursed
little brute of a cur ran out of a yard close by, and flew at the horse’s throat. I
thought something was going to happen by the look of the mare’s ears—and just as I was
about to let go the bridle and catch hold of the mane, up went her heels into the air, and
I was shot like a bullet from a gun slap over her head into the road.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. And poor little pug was kicked to death, I suppose.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. No, I had my revenge.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. How do you mean?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Why, I came down in a sitting posture, plump on his back—one
squeak, and it was all over.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>seeing that nothing is the matter with
her husband</i>) Come, William, I think you are nearly all right again now.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Yes, my dear, thank you, I shall get round again in a day or two,
I dare say. You were far more frightened than I was.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>smiling</i>) Oh come, William, I am not
quite so sure about that. Now the danger is over we can afford, you know, to laugh at it.
(<i>playfully</i>) You were not <i>at all</i> alarmed, were you, dear? Ha, ha! and the
droll manner in which you fell, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Exactly; it certainly broke his fall, and the dog’s back at the
same time. Much better than falling the other way. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>with good-humoured merriment</i>) Ha, ha,
ha! Only picture to yourselves my husband’s attitude after his descent, comfortably
sitting in the middle of the road without his hat. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Ha, ha, ha! With all the dirty little vagabonds in the parish
gathered around him! Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>getting offended</i>) I’m glad you’re amused! I really don’t
see the joke.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside, to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
S<small>WEET</small>) Don’t, Fanny! he don’t like it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>thrusting her handkerchief in her
mouth</i>) I oughtn’t to laugh, perhaps, but I positively can’t help it! Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. No, it makes one laugh in spite of one’self! Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>more offended</i>) Really, Mrs. Sweet, I consider this
behaviour of yours very extraordinary—not to say disgusting! Here have I been within a
hair’s breadth of losing my life, and you are turning the whole thing into ridicule.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Nay—now, don’t be angry—I can’t help myself.
Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Ha, ha, ha! Just imagine our friend here magnificently enthroned
in the gutter on the body of his prostrate enemy. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Mr. Short—sir, leave off!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Well, it is not my fault—it was your wife set me off. Ha, ha,
ha!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>looking angrily at his wife</i>) Yes, I know it was; and her
preposterous merriment explores her great want of feeling—the stony nature of her
heart!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>trying in vain to repress her
laughter</i>) Nay, now, Willie—</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Yes, ma’am, I repeat it—the stony nature of your heart!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Now, Willie, it’s ill-natured of you to say
that. If I could, for laughing, I should be angry with you. Ha, ha, ha! I <i>cannot</i>
stop myself! Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Damn it, madam—will you leave off?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. I can’t, William. Ha, ha, ha! The whole thing
seems so absurd to me now it’s all over, that I really can’t contain myself! Ha, ha, ha! I
shall do myself an injury! Ha, ha, ha! I’ll go out of the room, since it offends you. Ha,
ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>pacing the stage in a passion</i>) Such scandalous want of
feeling is abominable!—revolting!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>trying to pacify him</i>) Mr. Sweet,
pray—</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>interrupting her, and crossing to</i> <small>L</small>.) No,
Mrs. Short—I appeal to you—I appeal to you, ma’am—suppose this misfortune had happened to
Short, do you think for one moment that <i>you</i> would have been capable of such
behaviour? (<i>crosses to</i> <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Ah, Sweet!—but there’s no arguing by comparisons—all women are
not of the same sensitive disposition as my Louisa. I flatter myself they don’t all feel
things alike.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. But Fanny is the most affectionate creature
in the world, and I am sure, Mr. Sweet, is very sincerely attached to you. It was
evidently quite an hysterical affection wholly beyond her power to control—one of those
irresistible fits of laughter that we are all of us subject to at times.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. No, I shan’t pass it off so easily, I assure you. How does she
know what may be the end of it? There may be after symptoms.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Oh, don’t let us think of that—I trust that
you are not seriously hurt. Come now, I’ll go and fetch her—you must kiss and be
friends—you must indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Very well, Maria—I’ll come directly.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> M<small>ARIA</small>, <i>door</i>, <small>L</small>. 2
<small>E</small>.</p>

<p class="noindent">(<i>to</i> S<small>WEET</small>) There, you see, she has sent for me
to make it up with you.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Mrs. Short—listen to me.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. No, no—I’ll not hear another word. You must
be reconciled to your wife this very minute on pain of my severe displeasure.
(S<small>WEET</small> <i>is about to object</i>) No, no, I can’t hear you—not half a
syllable—I shall run and fetch her.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit, door</i>, <small>L</small>. 2 <small>E</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What a treasure you have in that woman, Short—she is a perfect
pattern—a model—an incomparable model of conjugal devotedness. It’s a good thing for you I
didn’t see her first. (<i>sits on sofa</i>, <small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. My dear friend, women are neither more nor less than what we make
them, at least in marriage. Louisa was not always the docile obedient wife you now see
her, not of course till all the tomfoolery of the honeymoon was over, and I began to take
the proper tone.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>rises</i>) Ah, why didn’t <i>I</i> take the proper tone.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Exactly. (<i>rises</i>) But it requires a peculiar tact—the
method of proceeding, I believe, is a secret not possessed by all.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Take pity on me, Short—tell it me—show me how you do it, and
you’ll bind me to you for life.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. You want firmness—you give way—and when once a married man, you
know, allows <i>two</i> voices in his house, it soon ends in there being only <i>one</i>,
and, you’ll excuse me, Sweet, the result is, he is led by the nose by his own wife, as
“Iago” says in the play, “as tenderly as asses are.”</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Yes, I am afraid I <i>have</i> been a very <i>great</i> ass, but
shall I suffer this state of things to go on till I become the laughing stock of all my
friends? No, never! I can’t sleep at nights for thinking of the difference between your
wife and mine. Zounds! I’m resolved I won’t put up with it any longer! I’ll be as much
master in my own house as you are—every jot as much. Who the devil are you that you should
carry it over me in this sort of way? Do you hear what I say, Short? I insist upon being
as much minded as you are, sir? I insist upon it! What can I do to show my authority? I
have it! I won’t go to the opera to-night!—I won’t dine at Billington’s—what do I care for
his mock turtle!—d—n his milk punch! I know she has set her heart upon it, but I won’t go.
There’ll be a precious kick up. She’ll fly into a passion—fall a crying—perhaps, have a
fit—and shall I give way? No, I’ll stand like a rock!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Well said! bravo! but you’ll be sure to give in again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Give in—you shall see!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. If you only keep your word you’ll be sure to succeed.</p>

we came down here a month ago to these lodgings with the Shorts,—I was contented enough

getting my own,—but I was a fool then, and didn’t know any better! Look at Short—my eyes
are opened now—see how much happier he is with <i>his wife</i> than <i>I</i> am with
<i>you!</i> I wish, ma’am, to be obeyed like Short—to be observed like Short—to be doated
on like Short—to be caressed like Short—to be petted like Short—to be patted like Short—to
be <i>fat</i> like Short! Why ain’t I of as much consequence as he is? Why is he always
obeyed when I am not? (<i>crosses to</i> <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Because he is less extravagant in his
desires, I suppose.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. How, ma’am!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Or else, perhaps, because he has a more
amiable way of making his wishes understood. In a word—because he doesn’t resemble
you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. This is downright personality—I give you fair warning—I am
getting into a most enormous passion!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>TEPHEN</small>, <small>L</small>.
<small>C</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>TEPH</small>. Mr. Billington is here, ma’am.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. We’re not at home. (<i>crosses to</i> <small>L</small>.) What does
he want?</p>

<p>S<small>TEPH</small>. He says, sir, he waited this morning nearly an hour in front of
the Crystal Palace, according to appointment, and finding that you didn’t come he has
called to enquire if there is anything the matter.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. We can’t see him—we’re not at home.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Impossible, you can’t mean it! What now, he
is in the house?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>to</i> S<small>TEPHEN</small>) Do you hear what I say?</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> S<small>TEPHEN</small>, <small>L</small>.
<small>C</small>.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. I never would have believed that you could
have behaved like this—what <i>will</i> Mr. Billington think of us?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What do I care?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. You <i>must</i> go to-night now, if it be
only to apologize to him—after keeping him waiting, too, all the morning.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. It will be time enough to-morrow—I shall see him in the City.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. I don’t understand your conduct, William—it
must be simply to vex and annoy <i>me</i>, that you refuse to accompany me this
evening.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. No, ma’am, I am acting advisedly, on principle.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Very well, sir—I see your object. You have
determined to make me unhappy, and you have perfectly succeeded. I am not accustomed to
these insane transports of passion, without the slightest motive. Your cruel treatment has
wounded me to that degree! (<i>crying</i>) What have I done to deserve it?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>softened</i>) Why, I can’t help feeling——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. So happy as we always lived together, till we
came down here. You’ll repent of this behaviour before long, depend upon it. I see how it
is—you want to make me your slave—the mere echo of your own lordly will. Very well, sir—I
submit; henceforward, you shall find me the most submissive of wives—every wish shall be
acquiesced in—every command obeyed: but—(<i>sobbing</i>)—I—I shall never—never love you
any more! (<i>crossing</i>, <small>L</small>., S<small>WEET</small> <i>follows her,
entreating, &amp;c., down</i>, <small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>moved by her tears</i>) But Mrs. Sweet—Fanny—my dear—don’t
cry—you <i>shall</i> go to the Opera—I’ll go with you—we’ll <i>all</i> go to the
Opera!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>sobbing</i>) Oh, how unhappy you have
made <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span>me!
(<i>sobbing</i>) I’ll go,—go and dress myself, William, and then, perhaps, when you’re
left to yourself, you’ll be sor—sorry for what you have done!</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit, sobbing, through door</i>, <small>L</small>. 1

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>wiping his eyes</i>) I have behaved like a barbarian to
her.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>HORT</small>, <i>door</i>, <small>L</small>. 1
<small>E</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Well, did it succeed?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>testily</i>) No, it didn’t.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. You astonish me.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. I am ten times more unhappy than I was before. I made her cry,
and I can’t bear it.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Well, it is rather painful at first, but it will come easier by
and bye.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. I tell you, then, I feel I have been making a brute of myself,
all through your confounded advice.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. How, Sweet? What’s that you say?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Certainly! Haven’t you been boasting about your happiness, and
your influence over your wife, ever since you have been down here? What the devil was that
to me? What was it to me whether she contradicted you or not? <i>My</i> wife <i>was</i> in
the habit of contradicting me, and I was accustomed to it.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Come—come!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. I shan’t! I say you have destroyed all my domestic peace!
(<i>crossing to</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. You misunderstand me, Sweet. Is that the way to talk to a
friend?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. You are no friend of mine—you’re an interfering meddling old
fellow. That has always been your great fault—interfering in what doesn’t concern you!
(<i>sits</i>, <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Come, I say, that’s a little too strong! Weren’t you
everlastingly boring me with your complaints—how I did this, and how I did t’other. Why I
was always able to get my own way, when you couldn’t get yours. Well, then, since you’re
so ungrateful—since you put me to it—I’ll tell you why. Simply because your wife doesn’t
care a straw for you!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>rises</i>) Short!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. No, not a button, depend upon it.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. It’s false—she does. Give me your reason for saying so.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. What better proof of it can you have than the fact of you not
being happy with her? You see how happy I am with mine.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Not happy with her! Do you mean seriously to insinuate that I am
not happy with her? Take care what you are doing, Short. Don’t try to disenchant my life
with horrible suspicions, but even if it were so, I shall never win her back to me by
violence and quarrelling. (<i>sits</i>, <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Of course not, I never think of quarrelling with my wife, and as
to violence, I hate it—on the contrary, I sometimes show her little delicate attentions
which women know well how to appreciate—for instance, she is going to the Opera
to-night—well, what do I do? Why I send up to Covent Garden market, and buy her a bouquet.
Billington was going to buy some for himself, and I entrusted him with the commission.
(S<small>WEET</small> <i>rises and runs</i>, <small>C</small>.) Where are you going?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. To buy something for my wife.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Buy something—what?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. I don’t know—anything—half a dozen things—everything I can
find.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Stay, stay!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Don’t hinder me! Let’s see, have I any money—yes, all right! I’ll
tell them to send in their whole stock for selection—the first shop I come to.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>detaining him</i>) Sweet, don’t be a fool—the first shop you
come to’s a pork butcher’s!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> M<small>ARIA</small>, <small>L</small>.

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Well, what do you want?</p>

<p>M<small>ARIA</small>. I beg your pardon, sir, I though my mistress was here.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. She’s in Mrs. Short’s room. What’s that? (<i>pointing to the
book</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>ARIA</small>. The fashion book, sir.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. A capital thought. Give it to me.</p>

<p>M<small>ARIA</small>. My mistress told me most particularly, sir, not to give it to any
one but her.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Never mind; I’ll take it to her myself. (M<small>ARIA</small>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside</i>) He’ll never get on with his wife; he has no
tact—not the slightest. (<i>observing</i> S<small>WEET</small>) Good gracious! Sweet,

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What’s this?</p>

am in a cold perspiration! Short!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Written in pencil.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. I have seen the hand somewhere.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Whose do you think it is?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. It strikes me all at once! It’s Billington’s!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Stop an instant, let me go and find my glasses.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>seizing hold of his arm</i>) Did you mark what the girl said,
that she was to be sure and give the book to nobody but my wife?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Yes, I heard her say that.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Let me read. (<i>reads</i>) “I waited for you all the morning.”
So he did!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Go on.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>reads</i>) “I am afraid to ask why you didn’t come. It is now
five days since I have seen you; this is cruel, but I implore of you to give me an
interview to-morrow in the lane at the back of the house at 2 o’clock if it be but for ten
minutes. We shall meet this evening, but I shall have no opportunity of being alone with
you. You will not refuse if you return the feelings that are consuming me.”</p>

this chair; try and recover yourself.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>he supports him to a chair</i>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>sinking into the chair</i>) Oh, Short!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Never mind, my dear fellow, I’ll stand by you. I’m your
friend.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Oh for some vent to my feelings!—something to tear! (<i>he
snatches</i> S<small>HORT</small>’<small>S</small> <i>handkerchief from his pocket and
tears it</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. What the devil are you doing? That’s one of my best half-dozen
French cambric. (<i>gathering up the pieces and putting them into his pocket</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>starting up</i>) Short, are you a good pistol shot?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>staggered by the question</i>) A good pistol shot? no, I
never fired a pistol in my life.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. You’ll revenge me if I fall? I expect it of you as my friend; you
said you’d stand by me.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. You don’t mean to say you’re going to challenge him?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What, not after he has seduced my wife’s affections?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What a lucky thing Louisa never asked him to
call.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Fight him, yes! across a handkerchief, in my shirt sleeves, with
a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other; you surely don’t mean that you would be
likely to take any active steps to prevent the meeting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Certainly not, if you don’t wish it.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. What you wouldn’t for instance, you think, be likely to go before
a magistrate, or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>laying his hand upon his heart</i>) You may rely upon my
friendship for not interfering.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) He can’t be in earnest. (<i>aloud</i>) Why you are
as bloodthirsty as I am—the traitress! that was why she was so anxious to see him when he
called; that was why she wanted to go the Opera to-night. But let me seek for some further
proof against her—something to utterly confound her. (<i>he begins to read the letter to
himself</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>also trying to read the letter over</i>
S<small>WEET</small>’<small>S</small> <i>shoulder</i>) I can’t see a word without my
glasses, what can I have done with them? Wait a moment, they must be somewhere in the
room. (<i>he goes to the back of the stage to look for his glasses, and discovers to the
Audience that they are hanging at his back</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>reading to himself in a low tone, while</i>
S<small>HORT</small> <i>is searching for his spectacles at the back</i>) Ah! “If you grant
my request, carry the bouquet of violets to-night, which I have taken measures for your
receiving from a safe hand, which can awaken no suspicion.” (<i>aloud—shouting</i>) The
viper!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>giving up the search, and coming forward</i>) What have you
found? anything fresh?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>showing him the letter</i>) Look—read—judge for yourself?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>trying in vain to read the letter</i>) No, it’s no
use—confound it, I can’t make out a word.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. A signal! a signal, Short! think of that! They are actually carry
on a secret correspondence, by means of signals.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. What signals? Why the devil don’t you read the letter?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. She shall <i>go</i> to-night, <i>she shall go</i>, but I’ll
<i>watch</i> her like a lynx.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Now be prudent; let me intreat of you to do nothing rashly.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>vehemently, putting back the letter into the book</i>) I’ll
give it her with my own hand, and she how she takes it!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>restraining him</i>) No, no, no; let me beg of you. In your
present state of excitement it would be madness; let <i>me</i> give it to her, I shall be
able to see more than you will, I am cooler—more collected.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Do you think so? Well, perhaps you are right. (<i>gives</i>
S<small>HORT</small> <i>the book</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Leave me to deal with her alone, Sweet; you are not fit to be
trusted just at present. Go and dress, go to your own room, and endeavour to calm
yourself.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Calm myself? Ha, ha! I have a good mind to <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-25">[Pg 25]</a></span>jump out of the window!
Don’t leave me long, or I shall do myself a mischief—I’m in a state of desperation.
(<i>seizes a knife from the table—</i>S<small>HORT</small> <i>takes it from him—exit
through door</i>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Poor fellow, he’s in a pitiable condition; but he has brought it
all upon himself, by over-indulging his wife to that absurd extent that he has completely
ruined his own domestic happiness. It might have been just the same with me, if I had been
fool enough to walk in his footsteps. I wish I could make out the contents of this letter
though! Stay!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>looking after him</i>) What is the matter
with your husband, Louisa? He appears to be in the high ropes about something.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>anxiously</i>) I haven’t the smallest
idea—he seemed very strange.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. He’s an oddity! I could scarcely keep my
countenance, although I am by no means in a merry humour. The gentlemen are bewitched, I
think—<i>my</i> good man in not in a <i>very</i> amiable frame of mind either. Ah, well,
we must leave them alone, and they’ll come round at their leisure, I suppose.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>anxiously</i>) What can be the reason, I
wonder?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. There, now, you’re going to torment yourself
about that. Why don’t you treat these things as I do? You are always in a state of
adoration of your husband—to his face, too. It is really very absurd of you, and is quite
spoiling him—besides, it is not only bad policy as far are you are concerned, <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-26">[Pg 26]</a></span>but it does me a

See—look here—(<i>comparing the dress she has on with the one in the book</i>)—it is

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>bantering her, and holding up the
letter</i>) Is this one of his <i>attentions?</i></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. No; the most extravagant height of consummate
impudence; and if I were not frightened out of my senses I should go into fits of
laughter.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Come, come, <i>Mrs. Demure;</i> I’ll have no
more of this—I shall take the liberty of destroying this delectable note. (<i>tearing it
to pieces, and putting them into her pocket</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Don’t scold me, for if I have been silly and
a little indiscreet—which mind I don’t confess—I have been sufficiently punished for it,
for I haven’t had a minute’s peace of mind ever since we have been down here, and, after
all, is there no excuse for me—see how I am treated!—he starts at the sound of a rat, runs
away from the bark of a dog, and couldn’t be induced to mount a horse if his life depended
on it, but he is not afraid to coerce and bully a poor defenceless wife. (<i>wiping away a
tear</i>) I am sure if my husband would only be a twentieth part as kind to me as dear Mr.
Sweet is to you I wouldn’t give him a moment’s vexation for the world.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Nonsense, Loo, it isn’t worth a tear, and you
know I have always told you it is all your own fault. You don’t go the right way to work
with him. I tell you what it is, my dear, you are too amiable by half, both at home and
<i>abroad</i>; but don’t alarm yourself, there is no great harm done, if we can only keep
the knowledge of all this ridiculous nonsense from our husbands; but judging from Mr.
Short’s delightful air just now I am not quite sure that that will be altogether so easy,
but mind, ma’am, no more <i>persecutions</i>, no more flirting.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. Only help me out of the scrape like a good
dear creature, and if ever I expose myself to anything of the kind again, may I——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside, making a sign to signify that
their husbands are coming</i>) Don’t be seen with that bouquet in your hand. Let us
exchange! Take mine! (<i>they exchange bouquets</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>whispering</i>) How shall we find an
excuse for not going?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>whispering</i>) Never mind that now.
Don’t be frightened—keep close to me, and if I give you a hint, be sure to take it.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>WEET</small> <i>and</i> S<small>HORT</small>,
<i>through door</i>, <small>R</small>., <i>in evening dress.</i></p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside to</i> S<small>WEET</small>) Be careful now what you
say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>seeing the bouquet in his wife’s hands</i>) There it is,
under my very nose!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) The bouquet!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>looking through his eye glass</i>) I can’t make it out very
well at this distance, but there is nothing extraordinary in her having a bouquet, so has
my wife.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>affecting an air of gaiety</i>) Well, you
see we are dressed first.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>struggling to keep down his feelings</i>) So I perceive.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. So we perceive, ma’am.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
S<small>HORT</small>) My husband is in the secret, that is quite clear. (<i>aloud to</i>
S<small>WEET</small> <i>and</i> S<small>HORT</small>) You are such beaux, you see, that
you have kept us waiting.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. We must have been a very long time dressing, Short, or else these
ladies must be very impatient to set out.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. True, Sweet, your remark is obviously correct.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>looking at his wife</i>) Minutes seems hours when the mind is
on the stretch of expectation.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside to</i> S<small>WEET</small>, <i>pulling him by the
skirts of his coat</i>) Ah! that’s all wrong! Take care!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. We shall be in plenty of time, ladies.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside</i>) That’s better—keep to the plural number, it sounds
less particular.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. We shall not be the last to arrive, I dare say. (<i>rings the
bell</i>)</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>TEPHEN</small>, <small>L</small>.

<p class="noindent">Is the coach at the door, Stephen?</p>

<p>S<small>TEPH</small>. Yes, sir, I was just coming to tell you as you rung.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I am suffocating!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>to</i> S<small>WEET</small>) My dear, do
you still feel disinclined to go?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>shouting</i>) No; not at all! (<i>to</i>
S<small>TEPHEN</small>) Give me my hat! (S<small>TEPHEN</small> <i>takes up his hat from
the sofa, which he keeps in his hand</i>) Not at all! (<i>aside</i>) If Stephen, now,
would but let my hat fall to give me an excuse for going into a passion. (<i>aloud to</i>
S<small>TEPHEN</small>) What are you doing with my hat, sir?</p>

<p>S<small>TEPH</small>. Me, sir; nothing, sir.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Ah! sir! do you dare to answer me, you scoundrel! Leave the room,
sir, or I’ll kick you down stairs!</p>

<p>S<small>TEPH</small>. (<i>aside, putting down the hat</i>) Master’s mad—I wasn’t doing
anything with the hat.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, <small>C</small>. <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Well, why don’t we go?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. We none of us seem very well inclined to do
that.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Why not! I never felt more disposed to go out in my life! I am in
extacies at the thought of it: so is Short.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>lugubriously</i>) Very much so, indeed, Sweet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>looking at his wife</i>) Short and I it is true are no great
hands at flirting with the ladies, but we can look on and see <i>others</i> doing so!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside—pulling him by the sleeve</i>) Sweet! Sweet!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>disregarding</i> S<small>HORT</small>, <i>and looking hard at
his wife</i>) Yes, ma’am, I say we can look on and see <i>others</i> doing so!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside</i>) He’ll spoil all. It’s impossible to restrain
him!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside to her husband, and covertly
pointing to</i> S<small>HORT</small>) Don’t for goodness’ sake make matters worse!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Make matters worse! Short, ma’am, is in my confidence!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside—perplexed</i>) I am lost—I can’t
make it out.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What does he mean?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>to his wife</i>) It was on <i>my</i> account, doubtless, that
you were so particular about you dress—to please <i>me!</i></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Well, yes—don’t you like it!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. And this bouquet: that, too, was to please me, I suppose!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside to</i> M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>,
<i>after crossing behind to</i> <small>L</small>. <i>of her</i>) What did you give her my
bouquet for?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. This bouquet! that you have been feasting your eyes on ever since
I have been in the room: that you haven’t had a minute out of your hand! Give it to me!
(<i>snatching it out of her hand</i>) See how <i>I</i> prize it too! (<i>he raises his
arm, and is about to dash it violently to the ground</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>crossing to</i> S<small>WEET</small>, <i>and seizing hold of
his arm</i>) Stop—stop, I say! What are you about? Don’t destroy my wife’s bouquet!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>after a pause of amazement</i>) What’s that? <i>Your—your</i>
wife’s bouquet? Do you mean to say that this—this bouquet belongs to Mrs. Short?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. To be sure I do? Didn’t I bring it all the way from the City on
purpose to make her a present of it?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Weugh! (<i>embraces his wife</i>) Laugh at me
again, Fanny! Ha, ha, ha! Scold me—snub me—turn me into ridicule. I’ll never contradict
you again as long as I live!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside—jogging her husband, and covertly
pointing to</i> S<small>HORT</small>) Hush—hush! (<i>to herself</i>) A light breaks in
upon me! (<i>to</i> M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>) You are safe—there’s some
mistake.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside—looking towards</i> S<small>WEET</small>) What’s the
matter with the man—has he taken leave of his senses?</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>significantly, to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
S<small>HORT</small>) Let me restore this bouquet to the rightful owner.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside, to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
S<small>WEET</small>, <i>taking the bouquet in confusion</i>) What am I to say?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside, to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
S<small>HORT</small>) Nothing! Now, <i>mind!</i> (<i>aloud</i>) Louisa, dear? What is
it?—she’ll faint. Here, Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-30">[Pg
30]</a></span>Short, come and help her. Here, smell these salts! There—there! (<i>fanning
her</i>—M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small> <i>sinks fainting into a chair</i>,
<small>L</small>.)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>while</i> M<small>RS</small>.
S<small>WEET</small> <i>is fanning her</i>) Oh, dear—oh! something has come over me so
suddenly—I am afraid I shan’t be able to go to-night.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Nonsense, my dear—it will soon pass off.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. Go, indeed! Impossible! She is more fit for
her bed than the Opera. (<i>aside, to</i> M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>) Now,
no yielding.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. No—I feel it would be quite out of the
question.</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>authoritatively</i>) Why, what is the meaning of all this?
You were well enough just now. (<i>aside, in a threatening tone</i>) Are you going to take
a leaf out of Mrs. Sweet’s book?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aloud in a totally changed manner</i>) My
dear?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. As Louisa seems so unwell, Willie, and as Mr.
Short, of course, can’t possibly leave his wife, suppose we send an excuse—I know you
don’t care about going.</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. Just as you please, my dear, whatever you like, I am agreeable to
anything. Come now, I tell you what I propose. (<i>looks significantly at</i>
M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>) As the place <i>doesn’t appear to agree with
Mrs. Short</i>, and as I think we have had enough of the Crystal Palace, I’ll stand treat
for a month at the sea-side—change of air will do us all good. What do you say?</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>significantly to</i> S<small>WEET</small>) Yes the sooner we
leave the better (<i>aside</i>) for <i>you.</i> (<i>significantly to</i>
M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>) What do <i>you</i> say, Mrs. Sweet?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>pretends to be confused, turns away her
head and smiles—aside</i>) Amusing!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>significantly to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
S<small>HORT</small>) What do <i>you</i> say, Mrs. Short?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>forces a laugh, turns away her head and
frowns—aside</i>) Provoking!</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. (<i>aside, looking contemptuously at</i> S<small>WEET</small>)
The idea of his putting up with the affront in this sort of way—Poor Sweet!</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>aside, to the Audience</i>) Capital joke, isn’t it? Poor
Short! Do him all the good in the world when he finds it out, won’t it?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WEET</small>. (<i>advancing and addressing the Audience
with her finger to her lips</i>) But keep the secret—don’t laugh till the curtain’s down.
And if it should so happen—you won’t be offended—that there is anything at all like this
going on at home, depend upon it, you might have done worse than coming to see——</p>

<p>S<small>HORT</small>. Short——</p>

<p>S<small>WEET</small>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sweet.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
